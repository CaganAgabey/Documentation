## **Step 1: Invite the Bot**
You can invite the bot using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=564426594144354315&scope=bot&permissions=805694544). The bot needs all permissions shown in order to function correctly. If these permissions are not present some functions may not work. The bot can be invited to any server where you have the **Manage Server** permission.

## **Step 2: Configure the Bot**
In order for the bot to work, it must be configured. See the [setup](es/admin/setup.md) documentation page for more information about how to start configuring the bot!

## **Step 3: Get suggesting!**
You and your members can now use the [suggest](es/all/suggest.md) command to suggest stuff.
