## **Step 1: Invite the Bot**
You can add the bot to your server by using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=564426594144354315&scope=bot&permissions=805694544). The bot needs all permissions shown to function correctly. If any of these permissions are missing, some functions may not work. The bot can be invited to any server where you have the **Manage Server** permission.

## **Step 2: Configure the Bot**
In order for the bot to work, it must be configured. There are three ways to setup the bot, [autosetup](admin/autosetup.md), a wizard-like [setup](admin/setup.md) and a fully manual [config](admin/config.md).

## **Step 3: Get suggesting!**
You can now use the [suggest](all/suggest.md) command to submit suggestions!
