### Description
This command is used to set up the server through interactive guide.

!>Initiating setup will wipe all the settings currently set on your server. If you already have configuration elements set, the bot will warn you and give you a chance to abort the command. Once you have confirmed you would like to initiate setup, there is no going back. If you want to configure the bot without clearing all your settings, take a look at the [config](NAME_OF_LANG/admin/config.md) command.
