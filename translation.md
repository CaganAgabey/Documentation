# Translating the Docs

If you are interested in translating the docs, you will need to be a translator for the bot [(Check the support server for more info)](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp).
If you are a translator for the bot, please DM ModMail in the support server and ask if you can translate the docs, the members of the support team will make everything ready for you and you will be given instructions. The translations are done via github, so if you are unsure about how it works, check out [this](https://help.github.com/en/github)
