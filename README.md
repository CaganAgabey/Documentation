# Suggester Docs {docsify-ignore-all}
---
Suggester is an [open source](https://github.com/Suggester-Bot/Suggester) bot that manages server suggestions, allowing staff to review suggestions before they are posted and manage them in many ways. This site has the documentation of all commands, as well as some other helpful information.

?> All **Usage** sections on these docs will assume that the command prefix is the default `.` prefix that is set when the bot is added to a server. The `config` command gives the option of changing the prefix, and if your server's prefix has been changed you should replace `.` with that prefix.

?> In this documentation, arguments in [brackets] are required, while arguments in (parenthesis) are optional. You also should not type out the brackets and parenthesis when using the commands.
